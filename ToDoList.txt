GAME
    -1 game constitutes a Shoot day - global timer 5min
    -new request comes in every time you fill one
        - game keeps track of how long it takes you to fill a request
        - bonus points if fast, negative points if slow
    - the faster you fill requests the more you get.
        - if you're fast, you get more points.
        - at the end: "You saved production x minutes!"
                      "You cost production x minutes! >:|
                -flavor text: how the shoot went
                       "actor spilled water on self"
                       "director was grumpy"

    - each round, grip person in charge asks for x amount of equipment and you have to find it.
        - Start with only one item (EASY MODE), later add more items OR more complicated items
    -Timer
        -If you go over, you are delaying the shoot!

    -Points tracker

    -Results screen

    -manifest - list of all items in truck.
        -hard mode: key grip/gaffer will call for items you don't have in truck. walkie talkie them back to say you DON'T have item.
        -harder mode: substitute an item that would work instead of what's needed.

    -Walkie talkie:
        - send item
        - say don't have item
            - Bonus points if you send a substitute that works
            - else, frowny face/grumpy flavor text

    -in the top right, journal button for a cheat sheet.

    -All equipment goes in an array, equipment.
        - Initialize each game round with an array, equipmentNeeded
        - randomize equipmentNeeded based on Sheree input
        - maybe give each a % probability for showing up? i.e. cameras will be needed 100% of the time?
        - or have set lists
        - scenarios??? night time shoot, day time, rain, etc????
