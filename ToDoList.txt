BestBoy is a find-the-object game where we search a grip truck for the equipment we need for a shoot.
You are a first year bestboy. 


LIST OF THINGS TO DEBUG:
- Component vs PureComponent
You should go for React.PureComponent when you can satisfy any of the below conditions.

    State/Props should be an immutable object
    State/Props should not have a hierarchy
    You should call forceUpdate when data changes




CURRENTLY WORKING ON:

firebase? for high scores
look up exgl
look up redux rematch library for high scores.
mute button: 'connect state of audio to rematch redux so mute state persists even if app is closed'

GAME
    - Header
        - Pause menu
        - Points Tracker
        - Timer
            - 30 second 'set up period'
            - x minute long day.
        - Mission title
        - Manifest (items in truck, pictures & descriptions)
    - Game
        - Truck
        - Assets (items to identify)
        - double tap to Zoom
        - tap to select item, then tap again and hold to set up.
            - Can prep items (takes ~3-5 seconds). Gives bonus points (speed up production!)
            - BUT at end of day, have to pack up items you prepped which takes time too.
        - Zoom capability 
            - Open containers. 
            - Explore inside of truck (Do we need this?)

            - maybe angry squeaky voice if you get something wrong
            - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA0DE3S3mNo
                - instructions on how to do it. i guess speed up x20 for the effect?

            - I think the instructions should scroll, and you tap radio to get instructions again. listening is important, right?
        - Radio
            - SEND
            - DON'T HAVE IT!
            - Text bubble spouting instructions, animated radio.

GAME
    -1 game constitutes a Shoot day - global timer 5min
    -new request comes in every time you fill one
        - game keeps track of how long it takes you to fill a request
        - bonus points if fast, negative points if slow
    - the faster you fill requests the more you get.
        - if you're fast, you get more points.
        - at the end: "You saved production x minutes!"
                      "You cost production x minutes! >:|
                -flavor text: how the shoot went
                       "actor spilled water on self"
                       "director was grumpy"

    - each round, grip person in charge asks for x amount of equipment and you have to find it.
        - Start with only one item (EASY MODE), later add more items OR more complicated items
    -Timer
        -If you go over, you are delaying the shoot!

    -Points tracker

    -Results screen

    -manifest - list of all items in truck.
        -hard mode: key grip/gaffer will call for items you don't have in truck. walkie talkie them back to say you DON'T have item.
        -harder mode: substitute an item that would work instead of what's needed.

    -Walkie talkie:
        - send item
        - say don't have item
            - Bonus points if you send a substitute that works
            - else, frowny face/grumpy flavor text

    -in the top right, journal button for a cheat sheet.

    -All equipment goes in an array, equipment.
        - Initialize each game round with an array, equipmentNeeded
        - randomize equipmentNeeded based on Sheree input
        - maybe give each a % probability for showing up? i.e. cameras will be needed 100% of the time?
        - or have set lists
        - scenarios??? night time shoot, day time, rain, etc????
         
    -Equipment is placed in truck - we should have something like 3 different truck layouts.

    -Zoom functionality for details.
        -Can open containers to search for items inside.
